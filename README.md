## 🔧 Smart Contract Integration

### Contract Configuration

The application is configured to integrate with Sui Move contracts:

```typescript
const CONTRACT_CONFIG = {
  PACKAGE_ID: '0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678',
  MODULES: {
    CARBON_CREDIT: 'carbon_credit',
    EMISSION_TRACKER: 'emission_tracker',
    COMMUNITY_REWARDS: 'community_rewards'
  }
};
```

### Key Functions

- `mint_carbon_credit()` - Create carbon credits from verified data
- `trade_credit()` - Execute peer-to-peer trading
- `verify_emission()` - Validate IoT sensor data
- `distribute_rewards()` - Auto-distribute community payments

## 📊 Business Model

- **5% transaction fee** on all carbon credit trades
- **60% reinvestment** into community health clinics
- **40% platform development** and expansion

## 🌍 Impact Goals
